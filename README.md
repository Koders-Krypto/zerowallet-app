## The Techie Stuff üë®‚Äçüè≠

Under the hood, Brewit Wallet is built on a Safe smart account, fully compatible with ERC-4337. This ensures smooth gas and account abstraction, making your life easier.

The onboarding process is a breeze, thanks to our passkey module that follows the ERC-7579 standard. No more hassle with complicated wallet setups!

Users can create automated investment strategies using our Session Key and DCA investment modules, which seamlessly integrate with Uniswap and ERC-4626 Vault contracts.

To keep everything running smoothly, we've got a scheduler service that uses a REST API to trigger jobs for each user's investment plan. No more manual intervention required!


All the contracts and Scheduler bot APIs are hosted in the zerowallet-contracts repository. Go check it out!
